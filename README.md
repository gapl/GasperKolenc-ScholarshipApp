# UIKonf Scholarship app
iOS app made for UIKonf conference's Scholarship.

This app is based on my Apple WWDC Student Scholarship 2014 app submission so it's still written in Objective-C, though its content has been updated for UIKonf scholarship.

App consists of three separate views: Timeline view of my life, digital CV and a view containing my past projects.
